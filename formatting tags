            A heading is a <b>word, phrase, or sentence</b> that appears at the beginning of a <i>written passage, such as a paragraph, chapter, or page</i>. Headings are similar to <u>titles and captions,</u> and they can indicate the subject of the passage below them. They can also help structure a document and help the reader understand its organization and find information.</br>
        </br>
            
            
            Headings can be <q>single words, short phrases, or complete sentences</q> that cover all of the material under them until the next heading. They can help readers identify the main points of each section in a <srike>paper, especially for complex readings</srike> like theses. In Word, headings can be set using "Styles" to ensure that assistive technology, like screen readers, will notify the listener of the header.</br>

            Headings are commonly used in <strong>certain disciplines, such as business, engineering, nursing, social work, and psychology</strong>. For example, you might write a heading for each chapter of a <del>novel</del> or on each page of a newsletter.</br>
